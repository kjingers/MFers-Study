# MFers Bible Study App — Overview

## Goal
A mobile-first web app for a small group to quickly access weekly Bible study content (reading + questions) and coordinate meals/headcount.

## Primary UX
When a user opens the app, they immediately see the **current/upcoming meeting week** (Tuesday-based) with:
- Reading assignment (with clickable verse references)
- Discussion questions (numbered, collapsible)
- Meal info + attendance/headcount

## Platforms
- **Mobile browser first** (iOS/Android)
- Desktop browser supported

## Notes
- MVP: no access code / auth during development
- Azure-hosted (Static Web Apps + Functions + Storage)
